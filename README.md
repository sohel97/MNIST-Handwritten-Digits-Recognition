# Handwritten Digit Recognition

GitHub repository for handwritten digit recognition with Google Colab and PyTorch.

### Project overview
This project uses [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset and Pytorch to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

The project is implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  platform so there is no need to install python or downlaod the dataset locally in your computer

### Data
I'm using [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for training purpose.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Google Colab Account

- Note: All Python libraries used in this code are already installed in Google Colab so there is no need to install them

### Installing

- Download the code in `digit_recognition.ipynb` notebook file.

- Upload the code to Google Colab.

- Unable GPU use at Google Colab(Runtime -> change runtime type -> GPU).
